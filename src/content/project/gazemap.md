## Key Learnings

In spearheading the development of an eye movement data visualization tool, I acquired valuable insights into diverse areas, including web application development, backend engineering, authentication integration, and data visualization. Key learnings from this project encompass:

- **Visualization Techniques:** Explored and implemented various eye movement data visualizations, enhancing expertise in interpreting visual attention patterns.

- **Interactive Linking:** Developed skills in creating interactive links between visualizations, providing users with a flexible and holistic analysis experience.

- **Web-Based Solutions:** Gained proficiency in building accessible and user-friendly web applications to facilitate collaborative data analysis.

- **Technological Integration:** Successfully integrated React for the frontend, FastAPI for backend processing, Firebase Auth for secure authentication, and D3.js for dynamic data visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Developed the web application frontend for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **FastAPI (Python):** Engineered the backend using FastAPI, ensuring robust data processing and seamless integration.
- **Firebase Auth:** Implemented authentication for secure user access.
- **D3.js:** Utilized D3.js for creating rich and interactive data visualizations.

## Abstract

This paper introduces an advanced eye movement data visualization tool designed for interpreting visual attention patterns. The project's primary objective is to create a user-friendly and accessible tool for analyzing eye movement data, culminating in a web-based solution to increase usability and facilitate collaborative data analysis.

### Visualization Techniques

The tool incorporates several eye movement data visualizations:

- **2D Density Plot:** Illustrates the concentration of eye movements in a 2D space.
- **Scanpath Representation:** Displays the sequential order of fixations and saccades during eye movement.
- **Bee Swarm:** Visualizes eye movement data distribution using a bee swarm plot.
- **Scarf Plot:** Represents eye movement patterns in a scarf-like visualization.
