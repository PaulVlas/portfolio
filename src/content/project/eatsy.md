## Key Learnings

In spearheading the development of an assistive eating game for children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP), I gained valuable insights across multiple domains, showcasing proficiency in software development, hardware integration, and agile project management. Key learnings from this project include:

- **Native Android App Development:** Developed a user-friendly Android app to facilitate the game, connecting seamlessly with both the Arduino and users' smartphones via Bluetooth.

- **Bluetooth Integration:** Acquired skills in utilizing Bluetooth technology to establish communication between the app and the Arduino, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

- **Arduino Programming:** Programmed the Arduino, incorporating an NFC scanner to detect selected NFC chips, enhancing the interactive elements of the game.

- **NFC Technology:** Explored and implemented NFC technology on the Arduino, allowing the detection of specific NFC chips for a personalized user experience.

- **Agile Project Management:** Learned and applied scrum methodologies in a team setting, working with a scrum master and participating in daily scrum meetings for effective project coordination.

## Technologies Used

### Hardware:

- **Arduino:** Programmed the Arduino microcontroller for interaction with NFC technology.

- **NFC Scanner:** Integrated an NFC scanner with the Arduino for detecting selected NFC chips.

### Software:

- **Native Android App:** Developed a user-friendly Android app to connect with the Arduino via Bluetooth and provide a seamless user interface.

- **Bluetooth Technology:** Utilized Bluetooth for communication between the Android app and the Arduino, ensuring real-time interaction.

## Abstract

This project addresses the imperative need for assistive technology to enhance the lives of individuals with impairments, disabilities, or the elderly, enabling them to live independently in their private homes. The chosen solution focuses on a game designed to assist children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP) in practicing independent eating and holding items.
