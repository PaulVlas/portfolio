## Key Learnings

Undertaking the Fairground project equipped me with valuable insights into various aspects of computer graphics. Key learnings from this project include:

- **OpenGL Framework:** Gained hands-on experience with the OpenGL framework, exploring its capabilities for rendering graphics and managing scenes.

- **Maven Project Setup:** Set up and worked with a Maven project, providing a streamlined development process and ensuring project consistency.

- **Geometric Object Rendering:** Developed skills in rendering geometric objects within the scene, extending the GUI and incorporating interactive elements.

- **Camera Implementations:** Implemented both a flying camera and a first-person camera, offering diverse perspectives within the virtual environment.

- **Shader Programming:** Utilized fragment shaders for controlling surface properties, enhancing the visual appeal of rendered objects.

- **Bezier Curves:** Implemented a winding, texture-mapped path using cubic Bezier curves, demonstrating a practical understanding of curve-based graphics.

- **Lighting Techniques:** Positioned light poles and implemented a night mode with toggle functionality, exploring lighting effects for improved scene aesthetics.

## Technologies Used

The Fairground OpenGL project was undertaken using a combination of technologies to explore and implement various computer graphics concepts. The key technologies include:

- **OpenGL:** Leveraged the OpenGL framework for rendering graphics and managing the virtual environment.

- **Java and Maven:** Utilized Java for application development and Maven for project management, ensuring consistency and efficiency.

## Abstract

The Fairground OpenGL project involved the exploration and application of computer graphics principles within the OpenGL framework. The assignment, structured into various exercises, provided hands-on experience in designing a fairground with animated attractions and surroundings.
